In this game I show you how to make Pac-Man move around the grid while avoiding walls, show you how to use the constructor method for all four ghosts to apply their unque characterisitcs to each one, including at what speed they move at. Clyde obviously being the slowest.

Inbuilt JavaScript functions I have used:
addEventListener()
getElementById()
querySelector()
for Loop
appendChild()
createElement()
push()
if else statements
classList
switch case
keyCode
forEach()
setTimeout
Class
constructor
setInterval()
removeEventListener
